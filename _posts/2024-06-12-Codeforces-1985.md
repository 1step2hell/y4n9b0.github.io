## problem A

[Creating Words](https://codeforces.com/contest/1985/problem/A){:target="_blank"}

Matthew is given two strings 𝑎 and 𝑏, both of length 3. He thinks it's particularly funny to create two new words by swapping the first character of 𝑎 with the first character of 𝑏. He wants you to output 𝑎 and 𝑏 after the swap.

Note that the new words may not necessarily be different.

**Input**<br>
The first line contains 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤100)  — the number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated strings, 𝑎 and 𝑏, both of length 3. The strings only contain lowercase Latin letters.

**Output**<br>
For each test case, after the swap, output 𝑎 and 𝑏, separated by a space.

**Example**
```
input
6
bit set
cat dog
hot dog
uwu owo
cat cat
zzz zzz

output
sit bet
dat cog
dot hog
owu uwo
cat cat
zzz zzz
```

**solution**
```kotlin
fun main() {
    repeat(readln().toInt()) {
        solve()
    }
}
 
fun solve() {
    val a = readln().toCharArray()
    val c = a[0]
    a[0] = a[4]
    a[4] = c
    println(String(a))
}
```

## problem B

[Maximum Multiple Sum](https://codeforces.com/contest/1985/problem/B){:target="_blank"}

Given an integer 𝑛, find an integer 𝑥 such that:

* 2≤𝑥≤𝑛.
* The sum of multiples of 𝑥 that are less than or equal to 𝑛 is maximized. Formally, 𝑥+2𝑥+3𝑥+⋯+𝑘𝑥 where 𝑘𝑥≤𝑛 is maximized over all possible values of 𝑥.

**Input**<br>
The first line contains 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤100) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single integer 𝑛 (2≤𝑛≤100).

**Output**<br>
For each test case, output an integer, the optimal value of 𝑥. It can be shown there is only one unique answer.

**Example**
```
input
2
3
15

output
3
2
```

**Note**<br>
For 𝑛=3, the possible values of 𝑥 are 2 and 3. The sum of all multiples of 2 less than or equal to 𝑛 is just 2, and the sum of all multiples of 3 less than or equal to 𝑛 is 3. Therefore, 3 is the optimal value of 𝑥.

For 𝑛=15, the optimal value of 𝑥 is 2. The sum of all multiples of 2 less than or equal to 𝑛 is 2+4+6+8+10+12+14=56, which can be proven to be the maximal over all other possible values of 𝑥.

**solution**
```kotlin
fun main() {
    repeat(readln().toInt()) {
        println(solve())
    }
}
 
fun solve(): Int {
    val n = readln().toInt()
    return if (n == 3) 3 else 2
}
```

## problem C

[Good Prefixes](https://codeforces.com/contest/1985/problem/C){:target="_blank"}

Alex thinks some array is good if there exists some element that can be represented as the sum of all other elements (the sum of all other elements is 0 if there are no other elements). For example, the array [1,6,3,2] is good since 1+3+2=6. Furthermore, the array [0] is also good. However, the arrays [1,2,3,4] and [1] are not good.

Alex has an array $$𝑎_1,𝑎_2,…,𝑎_𝑛$$. Help him count the number of good non-empty prefixes of the array 𝑎. In other words, count the number of integers 𝑖 (1≤𝑖≤𝑛) such that the length 𝑖 prefix (i.e. $$𝑎_1,𝑎_2,…,𝑎_𝑖$$) is good.

**Input**<br>
The first line of the input contains a single integer 𝑡 $$(1≤𝑡≤10^4)$$ — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛 $$(1≤𝑛≤2⋅10^5)$$ — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each test case contains 𝑛 integers $$𝑎_1,𝑎_2,…,𝑎_𝑛 (0≤𝑎_𝑖≤10^9)$$ — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 over all test cases does not exceed $$2⋅10^5$$.

**Output**<br>
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of good non-empty prefixes of the array 𝑎.

**Example**
```
input
7
1
0

4
1 1 2 0

0 1 2 1 4
7
1 1 0 3 5 2 12

output
1
0
3
3
4
1
2
```

**Note**<br>
In the fourth test case, the array has five prefixes:

* prefix [0] is a good array, as mentioned in the statement;
* prefix [0,1] is not a good array, since 0≠1;
* prefix [0,1,2] is not a good array, since 0≠1+2, 1≠0+2 and 2≠0+1;
* prefix [0,1,2,1] is a good array, since 2=0+1+1;
* prefix [0,1,2,1,4] is a good array, since 4=0+1+2+1.

As you can see, three of them are good, so the answer is 3.

**solution**
```kotlin
fun main() {
    repeat(readln().toInt()) {
        println(solve())
    }
}
 
fun solve(): Int {
    val n = readln().toInt()
    val a = readln().split(' ').map(String::toLong)
    var sum = 0L
    var max = 0L
    var cnt = 0
    a.forEach {
        max = max.coerceAtLeast(it)
        sum += it
        cnt += if (sum == 2 * max) 1 else 0
    }
    return cnt
}
```

## problem D

[Manhattan Circle](https://codeforces.com/contest/1985/problem/D){:target="_blank"}

Given a 𝑛 by 𝑚 grid consisting of '.' and '#' characters, there exists a whole manhattan circle on the grid. The top left corner of the grid has coordinates (1,1), and the bottom right corner has coordinates (𝑛,𝑚).

Point (𝑎,𝑏) belongs to the manhattan circle centered at (ℎ,𝑘) if `|ℎ−𝑎|+|𝑘−𝑏|<𝑟`, where 𝑟 is a positive constant.

On the grid, the set of points that are part of the manhattan circle is marked as '#'. Find the coordinates of the center of the circle.

**Input**<br>
The first line contains 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤1000)  — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 𝑛 and 𝑚 $$(1≤𝑛⋅𝑚≤2⋅10^5)$$ — the height and width of the grid, respectively.

The next 𝑛 lines contains 𝑚 characters '.' or '#'. If the character is '#', then the point is part of the manhattan circle.

It is guaranteed the sum of 𝑛⋅𝑚 over all test cases does not exceed $$2⋅10^5$$, and there is a whole manhattan circle on the grid.

**Output**<br>
For each test case, output the two integers, the coordinates of the center of the circle.

**Example**
```

**solution**
```kotlin
fun main() {
    repeat(readln().toInt()) {
        solve()
    }
}

fun solve() {
    val (n, m) = readln().split(' ').map(String::toInt)
    val a = Array(n) { charArrayOf() }
    repeat(n) {
        a[it] = readln().toCharArray()
    }
    var top = Int.MAX_VALUE
    var left = Int.MAX_VALUE
    var right = 0
    var bottom = 0
    a.forEachIndexed { index, chars ->
        chars.forEachIndexed { i, c ->
            if (c == '#') {
                top = top.coerceAtMost(index)
                bottom = bottom.coerceAtLeast(index)
                left = left.coerceAtMost(i)
                right = right.coerceAtLeast(i)
            }
        }
    }
    println("${(top + bottom) / 2 + 1} ${(left + right) / 2 + 1}")
}
```

## problem E

[Secret Box](https://codeforces.com/contest/1985/problem/E){:target="_blank"}

Ntarsis has a box 𝐵 with side lengths 𝑥, 𝑦, and 𝑧. It lies in the 3D coordinate plane, extending from (0,0,0) to (𝑥,𝑦,𝑧).

Ntarsis has a secret box 𝑆. He wants to choose its dimensions such that all side lengths are positive integers, and the volume of 𝑆 is 𝑘. He can place 𝑆 somewhere within 𝐵 such that:

* 𝑆 is parallel to all axes.every corner of 𝑆 lies on an integer coordinate.
* 𝑆 is magical, so when placed at an integer location inside 𝐵, it will not fall to the ground.

Among all possible ways to choose the dimensions of 𝑆, determine the maximum number of distinct locations he can choose to place his secret box 𝑆 inside 𝐵. Ntarsis does not rotate 𝑆 once its side lengths are selected.

**Input**<br>
The first line consists of an integer 𝑡, the number of test cases (1≤𝑡≤2000). The description of the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers 𝑥,𝑦,𝑧 and 𝑘 (1≤𝑥,𝑦,𝑧≤2000, 1≤𝑘≤𝑥⋅𝑦⋅𝑧).

It is guaranteed the sum of all 𝑥, sum of all 𝑦, and sum of all 𝑧 do not exceed 2000 over all test cases.

Note that 𝑘 may not fit in a standard 32-bit integer data type.

**Output**<br>
For each test case, output the answer as an integer on a new line. If there is no way to select the dimensions of 𝑆 so it fits in 𝐵, output 0.

**Example**
```
input
7
3 3 3 8
3 3 3 18
5 1 1 1
2 2 2 7
3 4 2 12
4 3 1 6
1800 1800 1800 4913000000

output
8
2
5
0
4
4
1030301
```

**Note**<br>
For the first test case, it is optimal to choose 𝑆 with side lengths 2, 2, and 2, which has a volume of 2⋅2⋅2=8. It can be shown there are 8 ways to put 𝑆 inside 𝐵.

The coordinate with the least 𝑥, 𝑦, and 𝑧 values for each possible arrangement of 𝑆 are:

1. (0,0,0)
2. (1,0,0)
3. (0,1,0)
4. (0,0,1)
5. (1,0,1)
6. (1,1,0)
7. (0,1,1)
8. (1,1,1)

The arrangement of 𝑆 with a coordinate of (0,0,0) is depicted below:
![secret-box]({{ '/styles/images/codeforces1985/problem-e-secret-box.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}){:width="353" height="auto"} 

For the second test case, 𝑆 with side lengths 2, 3, and 3 are optimal.

**solution**
```kotlin
fun main() {
    repeat(readln().toInt()) {
        println(solve())
    }
}

fun solve(): Long {
    val (x, y, z, k) = readln().split(' ').map(String::toLong)
    var ans = 0L
    for (ix in 1..x) {
        if (k.mod(ix) != 0L) continue
        for (iy in 1..y) {
            if (k.mod(ix * iy) != 0L) continue
            val iz = k.div(ix * iy)
            if (iz in 1..z) {
                val curr = (x - ix + 1) * (y - iy + 1) * (z - iz + 1)
                ans = ans.coerceAtLeast(curr)
            }
        }
    }
    return ans
}
```

## problem F

[Final Boss](https://codeforces.com/contest/1985/problem/F){:target="_blank"}

You are facing the final boss in your favorite video game. The boss enemy has ℎ health. Your character has 𝑛 attacks. The 𝑖'th attack deals $$𝑎_𝑖$$ damage to the boss but has a cooldown of $$𝑐_𝑖$$ turns, meaning the next time you can use this attack is turn $$𝑥+𝑐_𝑖$$ if your current turn is 𝑥. Each turn, you can use all attacks that are not currently on cooldown, all at once. If all attacks are on cooldown, you do nothing for the turn and skip to the next turn.

Initially, all attacks are not on cooldown. How many turns will you take to beat the boss? The boss is beaten when its health is 0 or less.

**Input**<br>
The first line contains 𝑡 $$(1≤𝑡≤10^4)$$  – the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers ℎ and 𝑛 $$(1≤ℎ,𝑛≤2⋅10^5)$$ – the health of the boss and the number of attacks you have.

The following line of each test case contains 𝑛 integers $$𝑎_1,𝑎_2,...,𝑎_𝑛 (1≤𝑎_𝑖≤2⋅10^5)$$ – the damage of your attacks.

The following line of each test case contains 𝑛 integers $$𝑐_1,𝑐_2,...,𝑐_𝑛 (1≤𝑐_𝑖≤2⋅10^5)$$ – the cooldown of your attacks.

It is guaranteed that the sum of ℎ and 𝑛 over all test cases does not exceed $$2⋅10^5$$.

**Output**<br>
For each test case, output an integer, the minimum number of turns required to beat the boss.

**Example**
```

```

**Note**<br>
For the first test case, you can use attacks 1 and 2 on the first turn, dealing 3 damage in total, and slaying the boss.

For the second case, you can beat the boss in 3 turns by using the following attacks:

Turn 1: Use attacks 1 and 2, dealing 3 damage to the boss. The boss now has 2 health left.

Turn 2: Use attack 2, dealing 1 damage to the boss. The boss now has 1 health left.

Turn 3: Use attack 1, dealing 2 damage to the boss. The boss now has −1 health left. Since its health is less than or equal to 0, you beat the boss.

For the sixth test case: remember to use 64-bit integers as the answer can get large.

```kotlin
import java.util.TreeSet

fun main() {
    repeat(readln().toInt()) {

            if (sum >= h) break
        }
        if (sum >= h) {

For the second test case, the only values of 𝑛 that satisfy the condition are 1, 10, and 11.

For the third test case, all values of 𝑛 between 10 inclusive and 100 exclusive satisfy the condition.
